# Unitree D1 — Forward Plan

**Start date:** December 25  
**Philosophy:** Verify → Freeze → Progress  
**Rule:** One phase active at a time

---

## December 25 — Phase 1 Closure (Today)

**Theme:** Stop at the right time

### Objectives

- Formally close Phase 1
- Freeze assumptions and artifacts
- Do no new experiments

### Tasks

Update your notes with:

- Phase 1: CLOSED (Dec 25)
- Zero repeatability validated
- Zero is an internal reference, not a pose

Ensure logs are:

- Saved
- Dated
- Untouched

Commit/tag repo if applicable:

- `phase1-zero-validated`

### Do NOT

- Re-run zero
- Compare visually
- Change power supplies
- Touch calibration

### Outcome

- Clean baseline
- Mental reset

---

## December 26 — Phase 2 Start: Single-Joint Characterization

**Theme:** One joint at a time

### Objectives

- Verify each joint responds correctly
- Establish qualitative correctness

### Tasks

For joints 0 → 6, one by one:

- Start from zero
- Command +10°
- Wait 2–3 seconds
- Command back to zero
- Log joint angles

### What to observe

- Correct joint moves
- Direction is consistent
- Returns near reference
- Other joints remain mostly still

### Do NOT

- Move multiple joints
- Use IK
- Adjust offsets
- Optimize motion

### Outcome

- Confidence that every actuator + encoder path works

---

## December 27 — Phase 2 Continuation: Reversibility & Symmetry

**Theme:** Repeatability under reversal

### Objectives

- Check hysteresis and symmetry

### Tasks

For each joint:

- Zero
- +10°
- −10°
- Back to zero
- Log angles

### What to observe

- Similar magnitude both directions
- No sticking
- No cumulative drift

### Outcome

- Mechanical health confirmed
- No silent binding or backlash surprises

---

## December 28 — Phase 2 Close + Documentation

**Theme:** Freeze again

### Objectives

- Close Phase 2 cleanly

### Tasks

Summarize for each joint:

- Moves? (Y/N)
- Reversible? (Y/N)
- Any anomalies?

Write:

- Phase 2: CLOSED (Dec 28)

Do not proceed further the same day

### Outcome

You now trust:

- Zero reference
- Individual joints

---

## December 29 — Phase 3 Start: Low-Speed Multi-Joint Motion

**Theme:** Controlled coordination

### Objectives

- Verify joints cooperate without conflict

### Tasks

- Define one safe pose (small angles)
- Use funcode = 2 with slow smoothing
- Move: Zero → Pose → Zero
- Log angles

### Do NOT

- Chase smoothness
- Tune gains
- Increase speed

### Outcome

- Multi-joint DDS control verified

---

## December 30 — Phase 3 Continuation: Coupling Observation

**Theme:** Observe, don't fix

### Objectives

- Identify joint coupling and gravity effects

### Tasks

- Repeat multi-joint moves
- Change order of motion

Observe:

- Which joints influence others
- Gravity-loaded axes behavior

### Outcome

- Mental map of real kinematics vs ideal

---

## December 31 — Phase 3 Close + Year Boundary Freeze

**Theme:** End clean

### Tasks

- Close Phase 3
- Write a one-page summary:
  - What is trusted
  - What is still unknown
- Stop work

---

## What Comes After (January, not now)

Only after all above:

- Define a canonical home pose
- Choose a reference frame
- Begin FK/IK modeling
- Introduce simulation alignment

---

## Global Rules (Do Not Break)

- Never fix what you haven't characterized
- Never optimize what you haven't verified
- Never re-open closed phases without evidence
