# Unitree D1 — State of Understanding (Carry Forward)

**Date written:** December 23  
**Next work session:** December 24  
**Context:** First deterministic bring-up, zero validation phase

---

## What Is Proven (Do NOT Re-question Tomorrow)

### System Health

- Robot firmware is healthy
- All `marm_*` services run correctly
- DDS communication works when bound to the correct NIC
- SDK binaries are correct and functional
- Telemetry stream (`get_arm_joint_angle`) is stable at ~10 Hz

### Networking (Locked In)

- **Robot IP:** `192.168.123.100/24`
- **Host IP:** `192.168.123.10/24`
- Dedicated NIC profile via NetworkManager
- DDS bound explicitly via:

```bash
export UNITREE_NETWORK_INTERFACE=enx4cea4168e514
```

> **⚠️ Important:** This is not optional, not cosmetic, not temporary

### Power Model (Accepted Reality)

- No power button
- Power = DC applied
- Motors disengage when power removed → arm falls
- This is expected industrial behavior

### What "Zero" Means (Important Mental Model)

- `arm_zero_control` moves to mechanical zero
- **Mechanical zero ≠ all joint angles = 0**
- Offsets (e.g. wrist ≈ 80°) are intentional

Zero is defined by:
- Encoder index
- Hard-stop geometry
- Internal calibration constants

> **Zero is a reference, not a suggestion.**

## What You Are Doing Right Now (Phase Definition)

**You are in Phase 1: Reference Validation**

You are **not**:
- Tuning
- Calibrating
- Correcting
- Optimizing
- Doing IK

**You are doing metrology.**

## What To Do Tomorrow (Exact Steps)

### 1. Zero Repeatability Logging (Primary Task)

**Goal:** Verify repeatability, not perfection.

**Procedure** (repeat 5–10 times):

1. Power off robot
2. Power on robot
3. Enable joints:
   ```bash
   ./joint_enable_control
   ```
4. Zero arm:
   ```bash
   ./arm_zero_control
   ```
5. Record telemetry for 10–30 seconds:
   ```bash
   ./get_arm_joint_angle > logs/2025-12-24_zero_cycle_XX.txt
   ```

### 2. What to Check in the Logs

For each joint:
- **Min value**
- **Max value**
- **Average value**

> You are checking **spread**, not equality.

**Good results:**
- ±0.2–0.5° spread → very good
- Stable averages across runs → excellent

**Red flags** (note but don't fix yet):
- Drifting offsets
- Increasing error per cycle
- Different resting values after identical procedures

### 3. What NOT to Do Tomorrow

**Do not:**
- Redefine zero
- Subtract offsets
- "Correct" angles in code
- Average values and overwrite anything
- Touch calibration constants

> **Zero must remain sacrosanct.**

## What the Logs Are For

**Right now:**
- Baseline reference
- Ground truth artifact

**Later:**
- Regression testing
- Health checks
- "Did something change?" evidence
- Safety verification

> **Keep them. Date them. Never delete them.**

---

## Conceptual Anchor (Remember This)

This is equivalent to checking that a watch returns to beat center — **not regulating it.**

Regulation comes later.

## What Comes After This Phase (Do Not Start Yet)

Only after zero repeatability is trusted:
- Single-joint range characterization
- Hysteresis testing (A → B → A)
- Slow trajectory tests
- Joint coupling observation
- Cartesian kinematics

> **Tomorrow is still Phase 1.**

## Grand Seiko Rule for Tomorrow

> **If nothing looks wrong, do nothing.**

> Restraint here is engineering maturity.
