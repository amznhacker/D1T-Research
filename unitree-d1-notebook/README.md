# Unitree D1 Notebook

**Merced Robotics**

This repository is a field notebook documenting the real bring-up, control, and operation
of a Unitree D1 robotic arm.

This is not marketing documentation.
This is not a tutorial rewritten from vendor docs.

This is **ground-truth engineering memory**, including:
- incorrect assumptions
- silent failures
- network identity issues
- DDS behavior
- power-cycle effects
- deterministic recovery procedures

The goal is repeatability, not polish.

Precision over convenience.  
Truth over comfort.
